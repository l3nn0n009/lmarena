Frontend Design Skill
Overview
This orchestrator skill composes five design dimensions with tech-specific implementations to create distinctive, production-grade frontends that avoid generic AI design patterns.

The 5 Dimensions:

Typography – Typeface selection, font pairings, weights, sizing, and hierarchy
Color & Theme – Emotional intent, color systems, and unexpected accents
Motion – Orchestrated animations, easing, and interaction choreography
Spatial Composition – Layout, spacing systems, and asymmetrical design
Backgrounds & Details – Subtle textures, gradients, and visual rewards
Tech Implementations (choose one):

React with Vite and Framer Motion
Vue (Options API or Composition API)
Svelte with custom animations
HTML/CSS/SCSS fundamentals
Design system integrations (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix, Material)
Quick Navigation
"I need to create..." - "I want to focus on..."
Typography dimension → See ./sub-skills/typography.md

Color & theme system → See ./sub-skills/color-theme.md

Motion & animations → See ./sub-skills/motion.md

Spatial layout & composition → See ./sub-skills/spatial.md

Backgrounds & visual details → See ./sub-skills/backgrounds.md

Design thinking checklist → See ./sub-skills/design-thinking.md

8-Phase Workflow
Design Thinking – Answer purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation
Typography – Select typefaces, weights, sizes, hierarchy
Color & Theme – Define emotional intent, color system, accents
Motion – Plan animations, easing, interaction sequences
Spatial Composition – Design layouts, spacing scales, asymmetry
Backgrounds & Details – Add subtle textures, gradients, micro-details
Implementation – Follow your tech-specific sub-skill
Validation – Design review, accessibility, performance, mobile
Anti-Patterns (Reject These)
Typography

❌ Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, system fonts
❌ Mid-range weights only (400, 500, 600)
❌ Incremental size scaling (48px → 40px → 32px)
Color

❌ Material Design trinity (Blue, Red, Green)
❌ Pure grays without personality (#999, #CCC)
❌ Oversaturated neon accents
Layout

❌ Everything centered (predictable, boring)
❌ Uniform padding everywhere
❌ "Default SaaS dashboard" aesthetic
Motion

❌ Linear timing on everything
❌ No animation at all
❌ Slow, sluggish transitions (2s+)
